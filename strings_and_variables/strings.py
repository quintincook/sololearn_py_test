#if you want to use text in python you have to use a string
print("you can use double quotations")
print('or single quotations')

#some characters cant be used in a string like if you want to use a double quotation in a double quotation 
# so you use a backlash:
print('Brian\'s mother: He\'s not an angel.')

#another ex
print('I\'m a programmer!... kinda')

#or: 
print("He said:\" I'm learning!\"")
