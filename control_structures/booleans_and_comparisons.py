#another type in python is the boolean type
# thera are two Boolean values: True and False
# they can be cfeated by camparing values, for instance by using the equal operator ==
my_boolean = True
print(my_boolean)

print(2 == 3)

print("hello" == "hello")

# another comparison operator, the not equal operator(!=), 
# evaluates to True if the items being compared arent equal,
#and False if they are 
print( 1 != 1) 
print("eleven" != "seven")
print(2 != 10)

#python also ahs operators that determine whether one number(float or integer) is greater than or smaller than another. these operators are > and < respectively. 
print(7 > 5)
print(10<10)
print(7>7.0)

#the greater than or equal to, and smaller than or equal to operators are >= and <=
# they are teh same as the strict greater than and smaller than operators, except that they return True when comparing equal numbers 
print(7 <= 8) 
print(9 >= 9.0)

#greater than and smaller than operators can aslo be used to campare strings
#lexicographically(the alphabetical order or words is based on the alphabetical order of their component letters) 
print("Annie" > "Andy")
