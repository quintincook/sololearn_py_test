#you can use variables to perforom corrisponding operations, just as you would with numbers and strings 
x = 7 
print(x)

print(x + 3)
print(x)

#variables can be reassigned as many times as you want, in order change their value. 
# in Python, variables dont have specific types, so you can assign a string to a variable, and later assign an integer to the same variable 
x = 123.456
print(x)

x = "this is a string"
print(x + "!")
#changing vaiables is possible but it is not good practice. so to avoid mistkaes, try to avoid overwriting the smae variables with different data types
