#concatentation - adding strings together - like integers and floats can be added 
print("Spam"+'eggs')
print("2"+"2")

#string operations
# - strings can be multipliedby integers. this produces a repeated version of the original string. 
# The order of the string and sthe integer doesn't matter, but the string usually comes first 
print("spam" * 3)
print(4 * '2')
#strings cant be multiplied by other strings  or by floats even if the float is a whole number 

#another ex: 
print("ni" * 3 + "!")

print(3 * "7")
